Motivation


The global music market was worth $26bn in 2021 (IFPI, 2022). This number rises each year, which might not be surprising- for many, music could be perceived as an important part of their lives. With technology advancing and moving from ownership concepts, the number of streaming subscribers also increases with time, and accounts for 65% of music industry revenue. (IFPI, 2022).Artistsâ€™ revenue can depend on the number of fans attending concerts, streaming statistics, selling licences and on promoting, selling products/services. The revenue is directly correlated with the number of fans (IFPI, 2022), thus if an artist wants to incorporate high profits, one can wonder what makes them popular.
It can be the outcome of a few factors like personality, connections, media appearance, years on stage and music they produce (IFPI, 2022). If focusing solely on music, thus what characteristics of a song make it more successful?
Song features can consist of audio, metadata and lyrics. 

With the use of Natural Language Processing a large amount of lyrics can be analysed. /b/Our goal is to check whether it is possible to be able to predict the rank on the chart solely from the lyrics of a song./b/
